SmartResearchHub
SmartResearchHub is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to streamline research, use case generation, and dataset discovery processes for businesses. By leveraging cutting-edge AI models and web scraping technologies, the app automatically gathers insights, creates actionable use cases, and searches for relevant datasets from public sources like Kaggle.

🚀 Project Overview
SmartResearchHub automates the research, use case generation, and dataset discovery tasks, helping businesses explore new opportunities, innovate products, and discover data-driven insights. The platform uses AI models and web scraping tools to:

Industry Research: Gathers information about a company’s market, offerings, and strategic goals.
Use Case Generation: Automatically generates use cases based on the research findings.
Dataset Search: Finds relevant datasets based on generated use cases and company goals.
File Export: Saves dataset search results in a downloadable markdown file.
✨ Features
Research Tasks: Automatically researches industry trends, company offerings, and strategic insights.
Use Case Generation: Generates actionable use cases tailored to a company’s goals and research findings.
Dataset Discovery: Searches for relevant datasets from Kaggle and other sources based on company-specific use cases.
Export Results: Downloads dataset search results in a clean, easy-to-read markdown format.
Customizable: Search terms and dataset retrieval can be customized according to the user's needs.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python
AI Models: Groq's LLaMA-3.2-90b-vision-preview for research and use case generation
Web Scraping: Serper API for dataset search across repositories like Kaggle
Frontend: Streamlit for building a user-friendly interface
Environment: Virtualenv for dependency management
⚙️ Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
API keys for Serper and Groq
Steps to Set Up
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartResearchHub.git
cd SmartResearchHub
Set up a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
🔑 Configuration
Before running the app, you'll need to set up two important environment variables:

SERPER_API_KEY: For accessing the Serper dataset search functionality
GROQ_API_KEY: For performing the AI-powered research and use case generation
To set the environment variables:

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
set SERPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
set GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
export SERPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Alternatively, you can use a .env file to load these variables automatically.

📝 Usage Guide
Run the Streamlit App:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Interact with the App:

Enter the Company Name: Input the name of the company you want to research.
Research: The app will gather insights on the company’s industry and strategic goals.
Generate Use Cases: Based on the research, the app will generate innovative use cases aligned with the company’s goals.
