Installation
To get started with SmartResearchHub, follow the steps below.

Step 1: Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartResearchHub.git
cd SmartResearchHub
Step 2: Set up a virtual environment
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Step 3: Activate the virtual environment
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Step 4: Install dependencies

Configuration
Before running the app, you need to set up two essential environment variables.

API Keys Required
SERPER_API_KEY: For accessing the Serper dataset search functionality.
GROQ_API_KEY: For performing the AI-powered research and use case generation.
To set the environment variables:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
set SERPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
set GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
export SERPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Alternatively, you can use a .env file to load these variables automatically.

Usage
Step 1: Run the Streamlit app
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Step 2: Interact with the app
Once the app is running, follow these steps:

Enter the Company Name: Input the name of the company for which you want to conduct research.
Research: The app will gather insights on the company’s industry and strategic goals.
Generate Use Cases: Based on the research, the app will generate innovative use cases that align with the company's goals.
Dataset Search: The app will search for relevant datasets that match the company’s use cases.
Export Results: Finally, the app will save the dataset results in a markdown file (relevant_datasets.md), which you can download and use.
